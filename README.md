# 🏡 House Price Prediction Model

![House Price Prediction](house.png)

A machine learning project to predict house prices using historical housing data. This repository demonstrates **data analysis, feature exploration, model training, and prediction** steps using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Real estate pricing prediction helps stakeholders—homebuyers, agents, investors—make data-driven decisions. This project takes a dataset of housing features (e.g., size, location attributes) and builds a regression model to estimate house prices.

## 📁 Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Housing.csv` | Dataset containing housing features and prices. |
| `HousingCostPrediction.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with the full ML pipeline — EDA, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. |
| `ch1.py` | Python script with core modeling logic (can be used standalone for training and prediction). |
| `house.png` | Visual/cover image used in this README. |

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand data distributions and correlations.
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale features.
- 📈 **Model Training** – Train regression models to learn housing price relationships.
- 🎯 **Performance Evaluation** – Use evaluation metrics like RMSE/R² (depending on the approach).
- 🤖 **Prediction** – Ready-to-use model for estimating house prices on new data.
